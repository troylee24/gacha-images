# 🖼️ GachaVerse Image Storage

This repository serves as the **image storage for the myRPG discord bot in the Gachaverse discord server**. It organizes images into folders based on their rarity, used dynamically by the bot for its features and commands.

## 📂 Folder structure

Each folder indicates a **specific rarity** (e.g. `common`, `rare`, `legendary`, etc.).

Within each folder, files follow this naming convention:


Where:

- `<name>` is the **desired name of the image**.  
  ✅ Use spaces between words.  
  ➔ Example: `Golden Dragon.png`

- `<extension>` is a valid image extension such as **jpg, png,** etc.

## ✅ Contribution guidelines

Please follow these rules carefully:

1. **Clone** this repository.
2. **Create a branch** from `master` for your changes.  
   ➔ Example branch name: `ellison-images`

3. **Add your images** to the appropriate rarity folder, ensuring you follow the naming convention described above.

4. **Commit and push** your changes to your branch.

5. **Create a Pull Request (PR)** from your branch into `master`.

6. **Wait for approval.**  
   - **All PRs must be approved by @troylee24** before they can be merged.

### ⚠️ Important rules

- Do **not** push directly to `master` (you physically cannot).  
- Ensure image names are clear, correctly capitalized, and separated by spaces.  
- Only valid image files should be added to the repo.

## 🙌 Thank you for contributing!
